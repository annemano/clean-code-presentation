# What is Clean Code?
> Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees

- Philosophy best summed up in this handbook by **Robert C. Martin, aka "Uncle Bob"**
- Principles, patterns, and practices of writing readable, scalable and testable code
- **SOLID, DRY, KISS, Law of Demeter** and **YAGNI** are some of these principles

# SOLID
The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design


<!--
- Acronym - each letter refers to a different principle
- Apply to any object-oriented design but also software component or microservices
- We'll go through each principle with examples, using an imaginary Space Invaders game

-->

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

- Easier to understand
- Less risk to break unrelated code
- Ask yourself: what is the responsibility of my component?

<!--
- Your class should have only one purpose

- When you have a change to make, it should very clear which class is impacted

- You should not be worried that you will break other unrelated code when making that change
-->

---

# Single Responsibility Principle
### Example: SRP broken

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Invader {
      +heal()
      +move()
      +render()
  }
```

Several reasons to change:
- change the logic on how an invader heals itself
- move the invader in different ways
- change the rendering service

<!--
This code does work, but you have to think that your program will grow, needs will change, and your code needs to be scalable.
-->
---

# Single Responsibility Principle
### Example: SRP fixed

```mermaid
classDiagram
  Invader <|-- InvaderMover
  Invader <|-- InvaderRenderer
  class Invader {
      +heal()
  }
  class InvaderMover {
      +move(Invader)
  }
  class InvaderRenderer {
      +render(Invader)
  }
```

Single reason for `Invader` to change: logic that handles the healing process

<!--
heal() is related to the Invader itself, what it knows about itself and can actually control
-->

---
layout: text-image
media: /openclosed_principle.jpg
---

# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities [...] should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


- You must expect that your project will change over time as new needs arise

- You should be able to change/add behavior without having to change the entity itself

---
layout: text-window
---

# Open/Closed Principle
### Example: OCP broken
::window::
```ruby
class InvaderAttack
  attr_reader :invaders

  def initialize(invaders)
    @invaders = invaders
  end

  def main_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      InvaderMover.new.move(invader)
      InvaderRenderer.new.render(invader)
    end
  end
end
```

<!--
Let's say I have a class that handles an attack, and there's a main loop. I use the InvaderMover to move and InvaderRenderer to render, because
that's all I have in my code right now.

Do you foresee which problems we might encounter?
-->

---
layout: text-window
---

# Open/Closed Principle
### Example: OCP broken

- Depending on concrete implementation of `InvaderMover` and `InvaderRenderer`
- If we need to change them, have different ways to move and render, we need to change `InvaderAttack` directly

::window::
```ruby{10-11}
class InvaderAttack
  attr_reader :invaders

  def initialize(invaders)
    @invaders = invaders
  end

  def main_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      InvaderMover.new.move(invader)
      InvaderRenderer.new.render(invader)
    end
  end
end
```
<!--
Invader Attack shouldn't know about InvaderMover and InvaderRenderer. It currently depends on them directly. What if we want to have more than one option for movers and renderers?
-->

---

# Open/Closed Principle
### Example: OCP fixed

```mermaid
classDiagram
  InvaderMover <|-- SimpleInvaderMover
  InvaderMover <|-- FancyInvaderMover
  class InvaderMover
  InvaderMover
  InvaderMover : move(Invader)

  class SimpleInvaderMover {
    +move(Invader)
  }

  class FancyInvaderMover {
    +move(Invader)
  }

  InvaderRenderer <|-- OpenGlInvaderRenderer
  InvaderRenderer <|-- DirectXInvaderRenderer
  class InvaderRenderer
  InvaderRenderer
  InvaderRenderer : render(Invader)

  class OpenGlInvaderRenderer {
    +render(Invader)
  }

  class DirectXInvaderRenderer {
    +render(Invader)
  }
```

<!--
First, we need new options for movers and renderers, and these classes inherit from a parent class. You can overwrite the methods where you need them to be different
-->

---
layout: text-window
---

# Open/Closed Principle
### Example: OCP fixed

- **Closed for modification**: no need to modify directly `InvaderAttack`
- **Open for extension**: we can inject new implementation at runtime

::window::
```ruby{6,7,12,13}
class InvaderAttack
  attr_reader :invaders, :mover, :renderer

  def initialize(invaders, mover, renderer)
    @invaders = invaders
    @mover = mover
    @renderer = renderer
  end

  def main_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      mover.move(invader)
      renderer.render(invader)
    end
  end
end
```
<!--
InvaderAttack now takes a mover and renderer in its initialize method, but it doesn't know about their specific implementation, other than they have a move() or render() method. We'll see this example again with Dependency Inversion Principle (D)

Note that it remains a bit risky with Ruby, because it doesn't check if the mover and renderer that you pass in the initialize method is of the right type. If you pass it another object which doesn't move or render, you will get an error. This is something that typed languages, like Typescript, would support you with.

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

- Replacing a type by its subtype will not break a program
- Must respect 3 rules:
  - Same methods signatures
  - Same methods conditions
  - Same class properties rules

---
layout: text-2cols
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Method Signature Rules: Contravariance of Arguments

- A subclass implementing a method of its superclass must have the same number of parameters.
- The type of each parameter in the subclass must be **the same or a supertype** of the type used in the respective parameter in the superclass method.

::right::
```mermaid
  classDiagram
    Projectile <|-- Missile
    Missile <|-- GuidedMissile
    Invader <|-- DiveBomber
    class Invader {
        +checkCollision(Missile)
    }
    class DiveBomber {
        +checkCollision(Projectile)
    }
```

---
layout: text-2cols
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Method Signature Rules: Covariance of Result

- Either both the subclass and superclass methods return a result, or they don’t.
- When they do return a result, the subclass method must return **the same type or a subtype** of the result returned by the superclass method.

::right::
```mermaid
  classDiagram
    Projectile <|-- Missile
    Missile <|-- GuidedMissile
    Invader <|-- DiveBomber
    class Invader {
        +Missile attack()
    }
    class DiveBomber {
        +GuidedMissile attack()
    }
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Method Signature Rules: Exception Rule Broken

- Any exceptions thrown by a subclass method should be **the same, or a subtype** of the exception thrown by the respective superclass method.

::window::
```ruby
class GraphicsException < RuntimeException; end

class OpenGlException < RuntimeException; end

class InvaderAttack
  def draw
    raise GraphicsException.new
  end
end

class FancyInvaderAttack < InvaderAttack
  def draw
    raise OpenGlException.new
  end
end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Method Signature Rules: Exception Rule Fixed
::window::
```ruby{3}
class GraphicsException < RuntimeException; end

class OpenGlException < GraphicsException; end

class InvaderAttack
  def draw
    raise GraphicsException.new
  end
end

class FancyInvaderAttack < InvaderAttack
  def draw
    raise OpenGlException.new
  end
end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Method Condition Rules: pre-condition rule

- The **pre-conditions** required by subclass methods **must not be stronger** than the pre-conditions required by the respective superclass method.

::window::
```ruby{3,13}
class Invader
  def check_collision(missile)
    if missile.nil?
      false
    else
      missile.intersects(self)
    end
  end
end

class DiveBomber < Invader
  def check_collision(missile)
    if missile.active?
      missile.intersects(self)
    else
      false
    end
  end
end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Method Condition Rules: post-condition rule

- The **post-conditions** guaranteed by subclass methods **must not be weaker** than the post-conditions guaranteed by the respective superclass method.

::window::
```ruby{4,6,20,22}
class Invader
  def check_collision(missile)
    if missile.nil?
      dummy_missile
    else
      missile.intersects(self) ? missile : dummy_missile
    end
  end

  private

  def dummy_missile
    Missile.new
  end
end

class DiveBomber < Invader
  def check_collision(missile)
    if missile.active?
      missile.intersects(self) ? missile : nil
    else
      nil
    end
  end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Class Property rules: Invariant Rule

- Any invariants guaranteed by a superclass must also be guaranteed by its subclass

::window::
```ruby{1,3,4,8,9,14,16}
class InvaderAttack
  def initialize(max_invaders)
    @max_invaders = max_invaders;
    @invaders = []
  end

  def add(invader)
    if invaders.size < @max_invaders
      @invaders << invader
    end
  end
end

class SuperInvaderAttack < InvaderAttack
  def add(invader)
    @invaders << invader
  end
end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Liskov Substitution Principle
### Class Property rules: Constraint Rule

- Constraints adhered to by a superclass must be adhered to by its subclasses.

::window::
```ruby{2,9,10}
class Invader
  attr_reader :strength

  def initialize(strength)
    @strength = strength
  end   
end

class DiveBomber < Invader 
  def set_strength(strength)
    @strength = strength
  end
end
```

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

- No client should depend on methods it does not use

---
layout: text-window
---

# Interface Segregation Principle
### Example: ISP broken

::window::
```ruby
class InvaderAttack
  def bomb(target, swoop)
    target.destroy
    puts "*swoop swoop*" if swoop
  end
end

class Bomber
  ...

  def attack(target)
    invader_attack.bomb(target, false)
  end
end

class Swooper
  ...

  def attack(target)
    invader_attack.bomb(target, true)
  end
end
```

<!--
Printing "swoop swoop" is only relevant when dealing with a Swooper, so here we have to pass a boolean to indicate if we want to use it or not. That violates the rule that clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
-->

---
layout: text-window
---

# Interface Segregation Principle
### Example: ISP fixed

::window::
```ruby{1,6,7,8,19,23,24}
class InvaderAttack
  def bomb(target)
    target.destroy
  end

  def swoop
    puts "*swoop swoop*"
  end
end

class Bomber
  ...

  def attack(target)
    invader_attack.bomb(target)
  end
end

class Swooper
 ...

  def attack(target)
    invader_attack.bomb(target)
    invader_attack.swoop
  end
end
```

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

- Closely tied to Open/Closed Principle
- DIP enables OCP

<!--

Any class that has a single responsibility needs things from other classes to work, but it shouldn't be dependent on their specific implementation.

A high-level module should not depend on a low-level module, especially that the low-level module has more chance to change more often than the high-level.

Both should depend on abstraction.
-->

---
layout: text-window
---

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
### Example

- We use Inversion of Control (IOC) to inject concrete implementations
- You can either do it manually or use [Dependency Injection Frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)

::window::
```ruby{11,12,13,15}
class InvaderAttack
  def initialize(invaders, mover, renderer)
    @invaders = invaders
    @mover = mover
    @renderer = renderer
  end

  ...
end

invaders = [Invader.new('small'), Invader.new('medium')]
mover = SimpleInvaderMover.new
renderer = DirectXInvaderRenderer.new

InvaderAttack.new(invaders, mover, renderer)
```

<!--
Coming back to the example we talked about in the Open Closed principle, we see here how we instantiate the invaders, mover and renderer outside the InvaderAttack class

You don't have this in Ruby, but in other languages (Spring with Java, C# with .NET), you can do Dependency Injection, which we won't cover here

layout: text-window

# Don't Repeat Yourself
>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system

- Repeated code is harder to maintain and scale
- Very likely to encounter errors if a change in logic is needed
- You should extract common logic into their own methods/functions

::window::
```ruby
# REPEATED CODE
class InvaderAttack
 ...

  def main_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      mover.move(invader)
      renderer.render(invader)
    end
  end

  def special_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      invader.heal(10)
      mover.move(invader)
      renderer.render(invader)
    end
  end
end
```

::window::
```ruby
# REFACTORED
class InvaderAttack

  def main_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      basic_attack(invader)
    end
  end

  def special_loop
    invaders.each do |invader|
      invader.heal(10)
      basic_attack(invader)
    end
  end

    mover.move(invader)
    renderer.render(invader)

# KISS
Keep it simple stupid

---
layout: text-window
---

# Keep it simple
>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand

- Code should be easy to understand and easy to maintain
- Divide your lengthy methods into short, simple pieces of logic
- Your code shouldn't need comments to explain what it does!
- Linters (like Rubocop for Ruby) will often warn you based on some metrics

::window::
```ruby
## Cyclomatic Complexity is too high!

def customer_order
  if customer_id.present? && !order_id.present?
    render_error :not_found, 'Invalid customer id' \
    unless @info.customer_id == customer_id
  elsif order_id.present? && !customer_id.present?
    render_error :not_found, 'Invalid order id' \
    unless @info.order_id == order_id
  elsif customer_id.present? && order_id.present?
    render_error :not_found, 'Invalid info' \
      unless @info.customer_id == customer_id &&
              @info.order_id == order_id
  end
end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Keep it simple

### First refactor:
- Extract conditions in their own simple methods
- Use clear names for your methods


::window::
```ruby

def customer_id_only?
  customer_id.present? && order_id.blank?
end

def order_id_only?
  order_id.present? && customer_id.blank?
end

def customer_id_valid?
  @info.customer_id == customer_id
end

def order_id_valid?
  @info.order_id == order_id
end

def full_order_info?
  customer_id.present? && order_id.present?
end

def full_order_info_valid?
  customer_id_valid? && order_id_valid?
end
```

---
layout: text-window
---

# Keep it simple

### First refactor (cont'd):
- Avoid nesting conditional statements

Now that it's easier to read, you can ask yourself: 

*"Am I missing anything? Does it do what I need?"*


::window::
```ruby

def customer_order
  if customer_id_only? && !customer_id_valid?
    render_error :not_found, 'Invalid customer id'
  elsif order_id_only? && !order_id_valid?
    render_error :not_found, 'Invalid order id'
  elsif full_order_info? && !full_order_info_valid?
    render_error :not_found, 'Invalid info'
  end
end

# Law of Demeter
### Principle of least knowledge

- Keep software entities independent of each other
- Reduce the communication or coupling between different classes - "don't talk to strangers"
- Put related classes in the same package, module or directory to achieve cohesion

::window::
```ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :games

  validates :email, presence: true
end

invader_game.user.email

# ⚠️WARNING⚠️ 
# INSTANCE OF GAME IS CALLING EMAIL VIA USER
```

<!--
The instance of game shouldn't know that user can call 'email'. Especially if later on, 'user' changes and 'email' as well, you would need to change it
everywhere you called it.

# You ain't gonna need it

- Implement features only **when you do need it**
- Avoid having to **maintain code** that is not being used, and might never be
- Also in line with the **Agile Methodology**

<!--
Do not code features just because you know how to do it (for example, don't code all CRUD actions at once if you don't need them all)

Do expect your code to change in the future and make sure it will be **easy to change**, but you can't predict what **exact changes** will be needed.

Thankfully, by following all the previous principles, you are making sure that when you DO need a feature, it's easy to implement in your existing code.
